      <h5><b>Cinem@pp</b></h5><p>
For my final project I chose to do a full-stack application called Cinem@pp.
What Is ? 
Cinemas and Movies database where everyone can create/recommend their favourite ones, uploading photos, adding the location, the phone, a website link, a description and more.
Tech Used
( HTML5 - CSS3 - BOOTSTRAP ). I used this tech to do the actual style of the project. All the pages are responsive and I've done it with Bootstrap. 
( JAVASCRIPT - JQUERY ). I have added some functions using jQuery which my favourite one is the countdown video at the beginning which will disappear after 14 seconds. 
( NODEJS ). Decided to use NodeJS for the Back-End. 
( ANGULARJS ). Used AngularJS for the Front-End. 
( HEROKU ). Deployed my app online with Heroku. 
( POSTMAN ). I used Postman to check if the Back-End was working. 
( MONGODB ). I used MongoDB to create a new database for my App. 
( GITHUB ). In order to save my bits while working on my project I used GitHub.
