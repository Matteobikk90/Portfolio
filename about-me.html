<p>I spent the last four years working as a waiter around the world (London, Barcelona & Sydney). For past time I enjoy playing tennis and football. One of my greatest passions is technology, everything that deals with electronics. I have a big interest in new devices and I like to keep updated with the latest product. I was looking for Web Development courses and when I came across the General Assembly immersive, I knew it was the one I wanted to take and I am now really proud to have finished. 
The web development Immersive course was the best educational experience I ever had in my educational career. The GA experience has taught me how to learn and help me discover my love in tech. I planned to continue to expand my knowledge and keep growing as a developer.</p>
